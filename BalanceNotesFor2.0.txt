need to complete the clear the farmers field quest and then kill an additional 36 snakes to get to level 3... a bit excessive
	make snakes give more XP or make alchemist area locked behind lower level

needed to kill 42 rats to get the potion recipe for quest 4, in the process leveling up 4 times. 
	leveling up this many times is fine. this balance feels good, but the deep forest 1 entrance and the trading road start entrance need to be locked behind higher levels
	maybe make the recipe drop chance higher and have the rats drop more experience (or increase the XP reward for the alchemist garden quest) so there is less of a grind

since the player doesn't get a new weapon, lizardfolk are too strong even at level 7 
	a possible fix is to add a weapon in the shop that can be bought for at most $500
	another possible fix is to make the lizardfolk weaker (but needing to buy a new weapon seems like a good intro to the shop)
