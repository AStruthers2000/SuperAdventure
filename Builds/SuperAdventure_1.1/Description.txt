This is the first build of SuperAdventure. 
The game works with minimal features. 

Changes from 1.0:
There are no gameplay changes made from 1.0. 
The source code was cleaned up to include LINQ instead of FOREACH in a lot of places. 
Text now scrolls to the bottom automatically so players don't need to do it themselves.

Features:
9 Locations
2 Quests
1 Weapon
1 Potion
3 Enemies

Maximum HP never increases
Gold can't be used
Experience impacts level - Level = (Experience / 100) + 1
Level doesn't mean anything
